# RL_intro
This repository is dedicated to learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) step by step, starting from the very basics.

# Goals
- Learn the fundamental theory behind RL (agents, environments, rewards).

- Implement algorithms from scratch without relying on heavy libraries at first.

- Build intuition with small coding projects and experiments.

- Provide clear explanations with code, math, and visualization.

# Environment
- Python 3.+

- Numpy

- Matplotlib

- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for visualizations)

# Resources
Textbooks:
- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)
